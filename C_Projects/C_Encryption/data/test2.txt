Happy Birthday! So last year I made you cookies, but I didn't have the time to do that again this year, so instead I'm going to leave you this secret message. And here it is: I've come to realize that you are pretty much my best friend and I just wanted you to know that any time you feel lonely, just remember that you'll always have me. Because I love you (as a friend) and I care about you and I don't want you to feel sad or lonely or depressed or anything bad like that. Because you don't have to be. So happy birthday. I hope you like my gift.(
