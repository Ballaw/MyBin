2. This one's the easiest to answer.  At ths moment I'm working all night to get HW done so I have time to do an essay during the week and possibly have time to enter a business proposal competition. So at this moment, no, I'm not happy. In a broader scope, I am content with how my life is at the moment. I wouldn't say I am happy, just that I have reached a somewhat stable place (well, except how I periodically fail to balance school/gym/sleep/life and lose one or more for a week or so (well, life is usually not much anyways)).  1. You ask whether I see you in my life in the future. I invite you to consider just how I came to read that statement, written on your blog, almost 3 years post HS. You are the person I compare everyone to on an intellectual level, and I have yet to find an adequate match. I am with someone now only because I didn't want to be alone anymore, not because I like her more than as a good friend, and certainly not because I've found someone who can intellectually satisfy me. In short, I hope you belong in my future. Keep in mind though, we are probably both guilty of idealizing each other. If you want to actually talk sometime, let me know.
